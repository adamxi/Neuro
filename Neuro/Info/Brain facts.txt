Structural plasticity: Homeostatic rule (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131010205325.htm)

"These results show that the formation of new synapses is driven by the tendency of neurons to maintain a 'pre-set' electrical activity level.
If the average electric activity falls below a certain threshold, the neurons begin to actively build new contact points. These are the basis
for new synapses that deliver additional input -- the neuron firing rate increases. This also works the other way round: as soon as the activity 
level exceeds an upper limit, the number of synaptic connections is reduced to prevent any overexcitation -- the neuron firing rate falls. Similar 
forms of homeostasis frequently occur in nature, for example in the regulation of body temperature and blood sugar levels.

However, Markus Butz stresses that this does not work without a certain minimal excitation of the neurons: "A neuron that no longer receives any 
stimuli loses even more synapses and will die off after some time. We must take this restriction into account if we want the results of our simulations 
to agree with observations." Using the visual cortex as an example, the neuroscientists have studied the principles according to which neurons form new 
connections and abandon existing synapses. In this region of the brain, about 10 % of the synapses are continuously regenerated. When the retina is 
damaged, this percentage increases even further."

"If the average electrical activity of a neuron exceeds some maximum level, it will withdraw dendritic spines
and retract neurite branches [65], which may reduce connectivity and hence activity. If activity becomes lower, the neuron will generate
vacant synaptic elements [66], increasing connectivity and activity. However, if activity comes below some minimum level, outgrowth and
synapse formation will be halted"
